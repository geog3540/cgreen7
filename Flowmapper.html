        <small>Flowmapping Project</small>

              <p class="card-text">I chose the diverging green color scheme in hopes to better show this directionality of the banana trade in South America. The use of the darker and lighter green help visualize the data as where the green is darker indicates a surplus of bananas whereas the light green indicates a deficit. The nodes are represented by density proportionate to the net volume of flow. The black was chosen so that they stand out in a sharp contract against the green, allowing map legibility without overwhelming the observer.The flow lines vary in thickness based on the tonnage of banana trade between locations. I used the pinkish purple gradient from color brewer to ensure that the lines were visually distinctive from the green background, especially if the viewer was colorblind. Another choice I made was to adjust the “show top flows” to 16 as it allowed for proper visualization without cluttering the data together and making it illegible. My goal overall for this map was to create a striking and easily distinguishable map for those with colorblindness that wasn’t overwhelming to the viewer. 
                This flow map easily shows the major importers and exporters of bananas in South America. The largest importers of bananas are Chile,Argentina, and Uruguary. These areas have the largest nodes representing high net inflow volumes. They also have the darker shade of green on the choropleth base map indicating a surplus of bananas. This means that they import much more bananas then they export. The dominant destination for these bananas seem to be in Argentina as that is where the majority of thick magenta lines showing the various sources their bananas are imported from. For exporting Ecudor, Colombia, and Peru seem to have have the largest amount of banana exports. This is shown by the flow lines leaving their nodes and very few if any coming in.The countries closer to the equator seems to be producing more bananas for export to the countries further away from the equator. This is most likely due to the conditions needed for bananas to thrive in tropical areas closer to the equator.
